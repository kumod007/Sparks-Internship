<h1>Machine Learning Projects from Sparks Foundation Internship</h1>

<p>This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects completed during my internship at Sparks Foundation. The projects cover a range of topics including data anlysis, data visualization and predictive modeling. Each project includes a detailed README file with instructions on how to run the code and explanations of the techniques used. These projects were completed using Python and various libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.</p>

<h2>Project List</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Project 1:</strong> Predicting Students Percentage based on the No. of Hours they study using Simple Linear Regression<br>
    Techniques used: Data Analysis, Data Visualizing, Data Splitting, Model Creation and Model Prediction<br>
    Results achieved: I obtained accuracy of 92% and predicted the model using new different data's
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Project 2:</strong> Clustering Different Species of iris flower using K-Means<br>
    Techniques used: Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data Splitting, K-Means Clustering, Clusters Visualization<br>
    Dataset used: Iris Dataset<br>
    Results achieved: I have obtained 3 cluster for 3 different species using the The Elbow Method.
