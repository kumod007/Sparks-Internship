INTRODUCTION: This project is a part of my internship at The Sparks Foundation. 

TITLE: Predicting Student percentage using Simple Linear Regression.

OBJECTIVE: 
1. The objective of this project is to predict the scores of students based on the number of hours they study. 
2. The dataset used for this project consists of two variables - hours and scores - which were collected from 25 students.

METHODOLOGY:
1. For this project, I used a simple linear regression model.
2. Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis that is used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the value of an independent variable.
3. In this case, the dependent variable is the student score, and the independent variable is the number of hours studied.

RESULTS:
1. The model was able to predict the student scores with a high degree of accuracy. 
2. The mean squared error (MSE) of the model was 3.9, which indicates that the model's predictions were close to the actual values. 
3. Additionally, the model's R-squared value was 0.98, which means that 98% of the variance in the student scores can be explained by the number of hours studied.

CONCLUSION:
1. This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using simple linear regression to predict student scores. 
2. By analyzing the relationship between the number of hours studied and the student scores, we can develop insights into how studying habits impact academic performance.
3. The code for this project is available on my Github repository, along with the dataset used for this analysis.
